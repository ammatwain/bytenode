# Introduction

This example is very simple. Inside `main.js`, we require `bytenode` module and ask it to compile `funny-crypt.src.js` to `funny-crypt.jsc` if it wasn't compiled already.

Just don't forget to remove all `*.src.js` files before distribution. This step needs to be automated somehow.

## How to run this example?
```console
npm install
npm start
```
